                    <p>As a field of computer science, artificial intelligence encompasses (and is often mentioned together with) machine learning and deep learning. These disciplines involve the development of AI algorithms, modeled after the decision-making processes of the human brain, that can learn from available data and make increasingly more accurate classifications or predictions over time. Artificial intelligence has gone through many cycles of hype, but even to skeptics, the release of ChatGPT seems to mark a turning point. The last time, the breakthroughs were in computer vision, but now the leap forward is in natural language processing (NLP).</p>
