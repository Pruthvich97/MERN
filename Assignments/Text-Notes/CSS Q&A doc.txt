Q)Explain the CSS Box Model and demonstrate its components with code.

The CSS Box Model describes how elements on a webpage are structured and how their dimensions are calculated. It has four main components: content, padding, border, and margin.

Border: The border surrounds the padding and content and defines the boundary of the element.

Margin: The margin is the space outside the border, which separates the element from other elements on the page.
